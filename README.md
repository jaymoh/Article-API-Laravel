# Article-API-Laravel
A Simple Laravel REST API implementation. </br>

The RESTFUL API uses <b><a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/eloquent-resources" target="_blank"> Eloquent: API Resources</a> </b> to transform models and model collections into JSON.</br>

Here is a great article on Medium for great inspiration on <a href="https://medium.com/@dinotedesco/using-laravel-5-5-resources-to-create-your-own-json-api-formatted-api-2c6af5e4d0e8" target="_blank"> using  Laravel Resources </a> to create a formatted API. 

The API is consumed by a <b><a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js</a></b> frontend, which presently comes bundled with Laravel, only requiring a few lines of code configuration to get started. 

I also have an <a href="https://github.com/jaymoh/Blog-Article-Drafter" target="_blank">Android app repo</a> that consumes this same API.
